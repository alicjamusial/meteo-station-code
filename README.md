### ◾ About the project

**Meteo station** is my small after-hours project that contains of **three** repositories:
- Meteo station code (this repo)
- [Meteo station PCB based on ESP32 ](https://github.com/alicjamusial/meteo-station-pcb)
- [Meteo station 3D prints](https://github.com/alicjamusial/meteo-station-3d-print)

As the name suggest, is a DIY self-sufficient weather measuring device. I decided to design it as a PCB board with goldpins to stick-in or stick-out individual components and sensors (ESP32, BME280 etc.) to make it more reusable. It could have - of course - been integrated on board, but it would be more expensive and time-consuming to create.

The code was written using **Arduino IDE**. It was meant to be quick and clear, not the best.

> **Warning** <br>
> This is a hobbyist project, so I take no responsibility for any possible issues you may encounter :)


I was inspired by solution created by [this guy on Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V30/). He did a good job, so I strongly recommand exploring his meteo projects!
